Question 2								         (30 Marks)
Write a program that generates 16 random lowercase letters of the alphabet (range aâ€“z inclusive) and then writes the letters to a file.
Each letter in the file should be separated by a | symbol with four letters per line.
No line should begin or end with a | symbol.
The program should also write control totals on the last 2 lines of the file as follows:

The second last line should show the letter(s) that was/were generated the most number of times.
Include the number of times generated as per sample file output.
The last line should show the letter(s) that was/were generated the least number of times.
Include the number of times generated as per sample file output.

Example file contents:
f|j|r|h
u|g|b|f
u|z|o|h
y|w|m|p
Generated the most number of times (2 times): f h u
Generated the least number of times (0 times): a c d e i k l n q s t v x
